### 2024-07-24

The higher taxonomy of Hymenoptera was added acording to [ITIS](https://www.checklistbank.org/dataset/2144/classification?taxonKey=152741) to include infraorders. This was motivated by [this issue](https://github.com/gbif/backbone-feedback/issues/1).

### 2024-07-16

Changes to reflect more recent revision of Chelicerata on [ITIS](https://github.com/CatalogueOfLife/data/issues/648)

### 2024-07-12
Simplifications made from  original  [Ruggiero et al. 2015 ](https://www.checklistbank.org/dataset/294066/about)

-  Arachnida [class] #  "should" be under Euchelicerata [class]
-  Copepoda [class] #  "should" be under  Maxillopoda


Merostomata [class] was keep as a class under chelicerata according to [worms](https://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id=150507) an [ITIS](https://www.checklistbank.org/dataset/2144/names?facet=rank&facet=issue&facet=status&facet=nomStatus&facet=nomCode&facet=nameType&facet=field&facet=authorship&facet=authorshipYear&facet=extinct&facet=environment&facet=origin&facet=sectorMode&facet=secondarySourceGroup&facet=sectorDatasetKey&facet=group&limit=50&offset=0&q=Merostomata&sortBy=taxonomic), this class is missing from Ruggiero et al. 2015. Nevertheless acording to Dave note on [this issue](https://github.com/CatalogueOfLife/data/issues/648), Xiphosura will be kept instead of Merostomata. So we will need to make some changes later.
