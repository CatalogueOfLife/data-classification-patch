Simplifications made from original Ruggiero et al. 2015

    Arachnida [class] # "should" be under Euchelicerata [class]
    Copepoda [class] # "should" be under Maxillopoda

Merostomata [class] was keep as a class under chelicerata according to worms an ITIS, this class is missing from Ruggiero et al. 2015. Nevertheless acording to Dave note on this issue, Xiphosura will be kept instead of Merostomata. So we will need to make some changes later.
